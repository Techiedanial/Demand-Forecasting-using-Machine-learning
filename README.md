# Demand-Forecasting-using-Machine-learning
This project aims to predict the demand (sales) for various products sold in multiple stores across different time periods.

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict the demand (sales) for various products sold in multiple stores across different time periods. By leveraging historical sales data and applying advanced machine learning techniques, the project intends to forecast the stock requirements for products, helping businesses optimize their inventory and avoid overstocking or understocking situations.

The project includes various stages such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and deployment of the best-performing model.
